# Music Organizer

Easily organize music based on ID3 tags or filenames.

For example, this will take a file like `/<artist>/<album>/<artist> - <title>.mp3` and move it the destination alphabetized by arist like `/<first_letter>/<artist>/<artist> - <title>.mp3`. **Note:** This does not modify filenames at all.

## Build

`npm run build`

## Usage

`organize-music.exe "D:\Music" "C:\Music"`
